skimage (0.9.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Stefan van der Walt ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #693523).
  * Replace mentions of old package name.

  [ Stefano Rivera ]
  * Convert from python-support to dh_python2.
  * Build with pybuild.
    - Run unit tests in the debian/tmp directory after installation, so that
      data files and compiled extensions are available. numpy's build system
      doesn't copy data to the build directory.
  * Split up the binary package with executable install scripts.
    - Bumped debhelper compat to 9, and build-depends, similarly.
  * Use dh_sphinxdoc to manage sphinx javascript.
  * Run the doctests during build.
